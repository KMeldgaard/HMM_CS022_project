We live in a wireless world! All the technologies and standards that have been
released in the past five years, along with the ones that will be released between now and
2020, means that almost everything we do—every aspect of our lives—has a wireless component.
In fact, wireless data communication is omnipresent today—in the cordless phones
we use in our homes and offices, in the over 6 billion cellular phones that roam the world,
even in warehouses, where wireless is used to keep track of inventory. Today, we can purchase
nearly all types of products or board a flight with our cellular phones and tablets,
thanks to wireless. Furthermore, homes, businesses, and even whole towns are now
equipped with wireless networks that allow residents, employees, and visitors to access the
Internet from anywhere using laptop computers, mobile phones, and tablets.
Whether you are a manager who needs a better understanding of the impact of wireless
communication devices, an IT professional looking to enhance your understanding of the
field by learning more about wireless data communications, or a student taking an introductory
course in this topic, Guide to Wireless Communications, Fourth Edition, will help you
in that journey and prepare you for more in-depth learning.
Approach
Since the introduction, in mid-1995, of infrared data interfaces in laptop computers, which
allowed two computers to communicate without wires, along with the publication, in 1997,
of the first IEEE 802.11 wireless local area network standards, the field of wireless data communications has continued to expand at a dramatic pace. This book provides the reader
with an in-depth introduction to wireless data communication technologies that are based on
standards, along with others that are important components of today’s wireless world. The
text covers the basics of radio frequency transmissions, transmitters, receivers, antennas,
IEEE 802.15.1 and Bluetooth, IEEE 802.15.4 and ZigBee standards for low-rate wireless personal
area networks, IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ad and the upcoming /ax and /ay standards for
wireless local area networking (Wi-Fi), IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) and Free Space Optics (infrared)
wireless metropolitan area networks, the evolution of cellular technology all the way to
5G and satellite wireless wide area networks, and, finally, radio frequency identification
(RFID) and near field communication (NFC). Many aspects of coexistence (the ability of
two or more of these technologies to work in the same physical space) are also discussed, as
are the basics of implementation and security issues for each of the mentioned technologies,
along with a comprehensive tour of the various business and residential applications of wireless
technologies in Chapter 12.
Using straightforward language, this text introduces the most important technical aspects of each
technology and can be used in classroom settings in technical colleges, early year university
courses, or for distance education. It features extensive linking to websites where the reader can
find additional materials. Please note, however, that although the URLs for some of these sites
were accurate at the time this book was printed, these web resources can change frequently.
This text’s pedagogical materials include Real-World Exercises, which further your learning
outside the classroom setting, and Hands-On Projects, which take you through the often
step-by-step process of performing tasks relevant to working in wireless communications. The
Hands-On Projects, which can be performed in the lab or at home, use inexpensive,
consumer-class equipment as well as freeware and demo versions of popular software. Finally,
there are Challenge Case Projects, team-based research projects that help expand the students’
knowledge of the technologies discussed and direct them to additional learning resources.
