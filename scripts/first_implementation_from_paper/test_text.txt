A career in data offers the best of both worlds. On the one hand, it is a secure
choice—demand for data talent continues to increase, and shows no sign of abating. With
data skills in your toolkit, you’re going to be in demand in virtually any industry. On the
other hand, it’s a brave new world out there. We’re producing massive amounts of data,
and that data is making amazing new things possible. But, the methods and strategies
we’re having to continually invent to harness all that data means the future is continually
being redefined in real time.
